  "description" : "[h1]Adds new weapon type, quarterstaff.[/h1]\nThe quarterstaff is nearly identical to the spear in usage except it does significantly less damage but has the added perks of a large amount of knockback and a quicker swing. Very useful for keeping enemies away from your face.\nCurrently only added to random generation, no crafting yet. (spawnitem commonqs etc...)\nArt entirely from vanilla assets. \n\n[url=community.playstarbound.com/threads/124193/]MEGATHREAD[/url]\nFind the server version on [url=https://github.com/IsaacHart/sbmod-qsarm]git.[/url]",
