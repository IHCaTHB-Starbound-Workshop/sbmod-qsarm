  "description" : "^#5aa9d6;Adds new weapon type, quarterstaff.^reset;

The quarterstaff is nearly identical to the spear in usage except it does significantly less damage but has the added perks of a large amount of knockback and a quicker swing. Very useful for keeping enemies away from your face.

Currently only added to random generation and merchant pools, no crafting yet. (spawnitem commonqs etc...)

Art entirely from vanilla assets.
