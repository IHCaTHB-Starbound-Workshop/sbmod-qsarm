  "description" : "[h1]Adds new weapon type, quarterstaff.[/h1]
The quarterstaff is nearly identical to the spear in usage except it does significantly less damage but has the added perks of a large amount of knockback and a quicker swing. Very useful for keeping enemies away from your face.
Currently only added to random generation, no crafting yet. (spawnitem commonqs etc...)
Art entirely from vanilla assets.
